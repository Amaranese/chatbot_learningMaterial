    "## Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are probabilistic machine models of language used for NLP comprehension tasks. They learn a probability of word occurrence over a sequence of words and use it to estimate the relative likelihood of different phrases. This is useful in many applications, such as speech recognition, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, machine translation, spelling correction, and many other applications.\n",

    "- Natural Language Processing  \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is concerned with enabling computers to interpret, analyze, and approximate the generation of human speech. Typically, this would refer to tasks such as generating responses to questions, translating languages, identifying languages, summarizing documents, understanding the sentiment of text, spell checking, speech recognition, and many other tasks. The field is at the intersection of linguistics, AI, and computer science.  \n",

    "## Natural Language Toolkit  \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a Python library used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "NLTK contains text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning. It also includes graphical demonstrations and sample data sets for NLP.\n",

    "- Text Similarity in NLP\n",
    "- Text similarity is a facet of NLP concerned with the similarity between texts. Two popular text similarity metrics are Levenshtein distance and cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Levenshtein distance, also called edit distance, is defined as the minimum number of edit operations (deletions, insertions, or substitutions) required to transform a text into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. To determine cosine similarity, text documents need to be converted into vectors.\n",

    "Optional Quantifiers in Regular Expressions\n",

    "In Regular expression, wildcards are denoted with the period `.` and it can match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace) in a piece of text. For example, the regular expression `.........` will match the text `orangutan`, `marsupial`, or any other 9-character text.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Regular Expression Ranges\n",
    "Regular expression ranges are used to specify a range of characters that can be matched. Common regular expression ranges include:   \n",
    "`[A-Z]`. : match any uppercase letter    \n",
    "`[a-z].` : match any lowercase letter    \n",
    "`[0-9]`. : match any digit    \n",

    "  \n",
    "## Shorthand Character Classes in Regular Expressions\n",
    "Shorthand character classes simplify writing regular expressions. For example, \\w represents the regex range [A-Za-z0-9_], \\d represents [0-9], \\W represents [^A-Za-z0-9_] matching any character not included by \\w, \\D represents [^0-9] matching any character not included by \\d.\n",

    "## Kleene Star & Kleene Plus in Regular Expressions\n",
    "In Regular expressions, the Kleene star(*) indicates that the preceding character can occur 0 or more times. For example, meo*w will match mew, meow, meooow, and meoooooooooooow. The Kleene plus(+) indicates that the preceding character can occur 1 or more times. For example, meo+w will match meow, meooow, and meoooooooooooow, but not match mew.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Grouping in Regular Expressions\n",
    "In Regular expressions, grouping is accomplished by open `( and close parenthesis )`. Thus the regular expression I love `(baboons|gorillas)` will match the text `I love baboons` as well as `I love gorillas`, as the grouping limits the reach of the | to the text within the parentheses."
