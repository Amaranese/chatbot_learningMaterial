My name is Joe. That is what my colleague, Milton Davidson,
calls me. He is a programmer and I am a computer program. I am
part of the Multivac-complex and am connected with other parts
all over the world. I know everything. Almost everything.
 I am Milton's private program. His Joe. He understands more
about programming than anyone in the world, and I am his
experimental model. He has made me speak better than any
other computer can.
 "It is just a matter of matching sounds to symbols, Joe," he
told me. "That's the way it works in the human brain even though
we still don't know what symbols there are in the brain. I know
the symbols in yours, and I can match them to words, one-toone." So I talk. I don't think I talk as well as I think, but Milton
says I talk very well. Milton has never married, though he is
nearly forty years old. He has never found the right woman, he
told me. One day he said, "I'll find her yet, Joe. I'm going to
find the best. I'm going to have true love and you're going to
help me. I'm tired of improving you in order to solve the
problems of the world. Solve my problem. Find me true love."
 I said, "What is true love?"
 "Never mind. That is abstract. Just find me the ideal girl. 
You are connected to the Multivac-complex so you can reach the
data banks of every human being in the world. We'll eliminate
them all by groups and classes until we're left with only one
person. The perfect person. She will be for me."
I said, "I am ready."
 He said, "Eliminate all men first."
 It was easy. His words activated symbols in my molecular
valves. I could reach out to make contact with the accumulated
data on every human being in the world. At his words, I withdrew
from 3,784,982,874 men. I kept contact with 3,786,112,090
women.
He said, "Eliminate all younger than twenty-five; all older than
forty. Then eliminate all with an IQ under 120; all with a height
under 150 centimeters and over 175 centimeters."
 He gave me exact measurements; he eliminated women with
living children; he eliminated women with various genetic
characteristics. "I'm not sure about eye color," he said. "Let
that go for a while. But no red hair. I don't like red hair."
 After two weeks, we were down to 235 women. They all spoke
English very well. Milton said he didn't want a language problem.
Even computer-translation would get in the way at intimate
moments.
 "I can't interview 235 women," he said. "It would take too 
much time, and people would discover what I am doing."
 "It would make trouble," I said. Milton had arranged me to do
things I wasn't designed to do. No one knew about that.
 "It's none of their business," he said, and the skin on his face
grew red. "I tell you what, Joe, I will bring in holographs, and you
check the list for similarities."
 He brought in holographs of women. "These are three beauty
contest winners," he said. "Do any of the 235 match?"
 Eight were very good matches and Milton said, "Good, you
have their data banks. Study requirements and needs in the job
market and arrange to have them assigned here. One at a time,
of course." He thought a while, moved his shoulders up and down,
and said, "Alphabetical order."
 That is one of the things I am not designed to do. Shifting
people from job to job for personal reasons is called
manipulation. I could do it now because Milton had arranged it. I
wasn't supposed to do it for anyone but him, though.
 The first girl arrived a week later. Milton's face turned red
when he saw her. He spoke as though it were hard to do so. They
were together a great deal and he paid no attention to me. One
time he said, "Let me take you to dinner."
 The next day he said to me, "It was no good, somehow. There
was something missing. She is a beautiful woman, but I didn't 
feel any touch of true love. Try the next one."
 It was the same with all eight. They were much alike. They
smiled a great deal and had pleasant voices, but Milton always
found it wasn't right. He said, "I can't understand it, Joe. You
and I have picked out the eight women who, in all the world, look
the best to me. They are ideal. Why don't they please me?"
 I said, "Do you please them?"
 His eyebrows moved and he pushed one fist hard against his
other hand. "That's it, Joe. It's a two-way street. If I am not
their ideal, they can't act in such a way as to be my ideal. I must
be their true love, too, but how do I do that?" He seemed to be
thinking all that day.
 The next morning he came to me and said, "I'm going to leave
it to you, Joe. All up to you. You have my data bank, and I am
going to tell you everything I know about myself. You fill up my
data bank in every possible detail but keep all additions to
yourself " “What will I do with the data bank, then, Milton?"
"Then you will match it to the 235 women. No, 227. Leave out
the eight you've seen. Arrange to have each undergo a
psychiatric examination. Fill up their data banks and compare
them with mine. Find correlations." (Arranging psychiatric
examinations is another thing that is against my original
instructions.)
 For weeks, Milton talked to me. He told me of his parents and
his siblings. He told me of his childhood and his schooling and his
adolescence. He told me of the young women he had admired
from a distance. His data bank grew and he adjusted me to
broaden and deepen my symbol-taking.
 He said, “You see, Joe, as you get more and more of me in
you, I adjust you to match me better and better. You get to
think more like me, so you understand me better. If you
understand me well enough, then any woman, whose data bank is
something you understand as well, would be my true love." He
kept talking to me and I came to understand him better and
better.
 I could make longer sentences and my expressions grew more
complicated. My speech began to sound a good deal like his in
vocabulary, word order and style. I said to him one time, "You
see, Milton, it isn't a matter of fitting a girl to a physical ideal
only. You need a girl who is a personal, emotional, temperamental
fit to you. If that happens, looks are secondary. If we can't find
the fit in these 227, we'll look elsewhere. We will find someone
who won't care how you look either, or how anyone would look, if
only there is the personality fit. What are looks?"
 "Absolutely," he said. "I would have known this if I had had
more to do with women in my life. Of course, thinking about it 
makes it all plain now."
 We always agreed; we thought so like each other. "We
shouldn't have any trouble, now, Milton, if you'd let me ask you
questions. I can see where, in your data bank, there are blank
spots and unevenesses." What followed, Milton said, was the
equivalent of a careful psychoanalysis. Of course. I was learning
from the psychiatric examinations of the 227 women-on all of
which I was keeping close tabs.
 Milton seemed quite happy. He said, "Talking to you, Joe, is
almost like talking to another self. Our personalities have come
to match perfectly!"
 "So will the personality of the woman we choose."
 For I had found her and she was one of the 227 after all. Her
name was Charity Jones and she was an Evaluator at the Library
of History in Witchita. Her extended data bank fit ours
perfectly. All the other women had fallen into discard in one
respect or another as the data banks grew fuller, but with
Charity there was increasing and astonishing resonance.
 I didn't have to describe her to Milton. Milton had
coordinated my symbolism so closely with his own I could tell the
resonance directly. It fit me. Next it was a matter of adjusting
the work sheets and job requirements in such a way as to get
Charity assigned to us. It must be done very delicately, so no one 
would know that anything illegal had taken place.
 Of course, Milton himself knew, since it was he who arranged
it and that had to be taken care of too. When they came to
arrest him on grounds of malfeasance in office, it was,
fortunately, for something that had taken place ten years ago.
He had told me about it, of course, so it was easy to arrange-and
he won't talk about me for that would make his offense much
worse.
 He's gone, and tomorrow is February 14. Valentine's Day.
Charity will arrive then with her cool hands and her sweet voice.
I will teach her how to operate me and how to care for me. What
do looks matter when our personalities will resonate?
 I will say to her, "I am Joe, and you are my true love."
